title: Digitalization framework for energy optimization and smart maintenance of historic buildings
summary: This project aims to develop a cloud-based digitalization framework for energy optimization and smart maintenance of historic buildings. Within the project, digital twins corresponding to three selected historic buildings in Norrk√∂ping will be created and artificial intelligence will be developed. The project is expected to provide a deeper understanding of the operating and use conditions for historic buildings and make it possible to automatically control the building's heating depending on internal heat loads and other specific operating conditions.
