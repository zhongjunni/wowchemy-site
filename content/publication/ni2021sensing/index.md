abstract: Monitoring the indoor environment of historic buildings helps to identify potential risks, provide guidelines for improving regular maintenance, and preserve cultural artifacts. However, most of the existing monitoring systems proposed for historic buildings are not for general digitization purposes that provide data for smart services employing, e.g., artificial intelligence with machine learning. In addition, considering that preserving historic buildings is a long-term process that demands preventive maintenance, a monitoring system requires stable and scalable storage and computing resources. In this paper, a digitalization framework is proposed for smart preservation of historic buildings. A sensing system following the architecture of this framework is implemented by integrating various advanced digitalization techniques, such as Internet of Things, Edge computing, and Cloud computing. The sensing system realizes remote data collection, enables viewing real-time and historical data, and provides the capability for performing real-time analysis to achieve preventive maintenance of historic buildings in future research. Field testing results show that the implemented sensing system has a 2% end-to-end loss rate for collecting data samples and the loss rate can be decreased to 0.3%. The low loss rate indicates that the proposed sensing system has high stability and meets the requirements for long-term monitoring of historic buildings.
