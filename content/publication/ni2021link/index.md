abstract: Information and communication technologies (ICTs) help preserve historic buildings and optimize energy efficiency. This study proposes a digitalization framework for historic buildings by utilizing ICTs, such as Internet of Things (IoT), digital twins, and cloud computing. A digital twin is a digital representation of physical world assets that genuinely reflects the properties of real-world objects and processes. In this study, historic buildings are modeled with cloud-based digital twins. Indoor environmental data are collected with locally deployed sensors and ingested to a digital twin in real-time. The digital twin enables decision-makers to remotely monitor the indoor environment of a historic building and actively manipulate actuators to perform maintenance. Empowered by data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), a digital twin can further simulate and predict state changes in a historic building to reach desired autonomous maintenance and energy saving.
